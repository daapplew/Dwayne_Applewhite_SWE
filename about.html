    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Iâ€™m a frontend developer with several years of practical knowledge making the user experience interactive, intuitive,
        and ergonomic.<br><br>
    
        My biggest motivation is making web interfaces come to life; problems that require out-of-the-box thinking. My
        background is at the intersection of web development, digital marketing, and business. I also have an interest in
        improving my fluency with data, which can be utilized to improve strategy and guide decision-making. With one foot
        in
        the door of technology and the other in entertainment, the past years have been challenging and rewarding for my
        growth.
        I mean this both as a web developer and in terms of management skills working with a diverse audience with varying
        technical aptitudes. My projects and engagements have taken me from Los Angeles to Dubai and many places in
        between.<br><br>
    
        Outside of work I enjoy travel, competitive basketball, and chess. I'm also enjoying learning new programming
        languages
        and keeping up-to-date with new technologies that can advance my skills, such as artificial intelligence and cyber
        security.
